Characteristics and principles</h2><p>NFTs represent verifiable scarcity, portability, and programmability of digital property. NFTs have these properties due to a piece of code (smart contract) residing on a blockchain such as Ethereum that specifies multiple functions that can be used to create new tokens and interact with them.</p><ol><li>Verifiable scarcity means that certain NFTs are verifiably limited. This feature comes from the fact that there may be a function called "mint" in the smart contract, which can be called by anyone in the world. When called, this function will check some variables for global count to ensure that it is on the blockchain. Minting of the same type of product (such as the cards representing Messi in the blockchain game Sorare) is less than a certain value (such as 1,000).</li><li>Portability refers to the interoperability and tradability of NFTs.<ol><li>Interoperability i.e. NFT standards allow NFTs to be transferred across multiple ecosystems, as open NFT standards provide a clear, consistent, reliable and authorized API for reading and writing data.</li><li>Tradability means that NFTs can be freely traded and exchanged. Thanks to its non-copyable and tamper-resistant encrypted digital proof of stake properties, blockchains such as Ethereum will become a "machine" that records states, permanently tracking all changes and activities over time, and globalizing these states. Shared, anyone can view it anytime. Everyone in the world can transact with anyone else and do almost anything, including creating, selling, and transferring NFTs.</li></ol></li><li>Programmability means that NFTs can be designed to be dynamic, interactive works that change according to certain conditions. Such as <em><a href=https://medium.com/ethernitychain/dak-prescott-x-ethernity-89e558ebd880 target=_blank rel=noopener>Dak Prescott</a></em> is such an NFT work, the NFT will change its style every week according to the player's performance: when the QBR score is A standard performance of 60-75, you'll see Dak in futuristic blue and silver attire, maintaining a throwing motion as if ready to lead his team to victory; and a sizzling performance with a QBR rating of 75, Dak would be wearing a fiery red outfit and held high by his teammates.</li></ol><p>The following is a comprehensive scenario of NFTs, which fully reflects the various characteristics of NFTs:</p><blockquote><p><em>I log into a VR casino with my virtual identity (verifiable scarcity), then pull up to a chair and the dealer will recognize my avatar as a TBI (digital representation of property). Since this is my 10th time at the casino and I've been using the heater, my player card is glowing hot (programmable), signaling that other players should come to my table. Casinos like this and decided to send me a virtual "drink ticket" that can be redeemed in any app that recognizes these NFTs like Uber, Eats, Drizzly (portability). - "Crypto Theses for 2022" from Messari</em></p></blockquote><p>A simple operation logic diagram of NFTs is shown in the following figure,</p><p><img src=https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1h2bjx3bzdtj223b0u0qcl.jpg alt=NFT逻辑原理.png></p><ol><li>Suppose Alice owns 888 ETH in the current state and calls the mint function of the RandomCat NFT smart contract, passing it 69 ETH as payment to create RandomCat #420. The Ethereum blockchain will record a new state after this transaction that Alice now has only 819 ETH but has an NFT token in her wallet address representing RandomCat #420 and the RandomCat NFT smart contract address will now be 69 ETH or more.</li><li>Now suppose Alice decides to sell her RandomCat NFT to Bob for 100 ETH. As a result of this transaction, the Ethereum blockchain state machine is now again transitioning to a new state, and now the recorded fact is that Alice has 919 ETH and no RandomCat NFT, and Bob now has 100 less ETH but one more RandomCat # 420 NFTs.</li></ol><p>It can be easily seen that smart contracts are the center of the operation of NFTs. There are many NFT smart contracts. At present, the mainstream smart contract protocols include ERC-721, ERC-1155 and ERC-998, etc., which are similar to homogeneous tokens. The differences between the protocol ERC-20 are as follows:</p><div class=table-container><table><thead><tr><th>Features/Classes</th><th>ERC-20</th><th>ERC-721</th><th>ERC-1155</th><th>ERC-998</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Definition</td><td>Homogeneous Token</td><td>Non-Fungible Token</td><td>Semi-Fungible Token</td><td>Combinable Non-Fungible Token</td></tr><tr><td>Features</td><td>Tokens are compatible with Ethereum wallets, standardized, universal, compatible, and easy to interact</td><td>Each token is unique and can represent asset ownership</td><td>Can integrate different tokens for packaging</td><td>Can contain multiple ERC-721 and ERC- 20 Tokens</td></tr><tr><td>Divisibility</td><td>Token Divisible</td><td>Token Indivisible</td><td>Conversion Allowed</td><td>Token Indivisible</td></tr><tr><td>Transferability</td><td>Supports transfer between Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized applications</td><td>Supports the transfer of one token at a time</td><td>It can be merged into a token package and transferred in batches, and the token package has an independent ID</td><td>Can be transferred in batches</td></tr><tr><td>Advantages</td><td>Functions such as transfer, request, approval, etc. can be easily realized</td><td>Allows tracking of ownership records of assets, all assets are unique</td><td>Cross-chain, destroyable to improve overall scarcity</td><td>Detachable, synthesizable</td></tr><tr><td>Defects</td><td>Accepting instructions is prone to problems and can easily lead to asset loss</td><td>A contract can only issue one NFT asset</td><td>Information loss; sacrificing the degree of network decentralization</td><td>New standard, to be tested</td></tr><tr><td>Application scenarios</td><td>OMG, SNC, TRX and other tokens</td><td>Collectibles/arts, securities, etc.</td><td>Collectibles, games, virtual worlds, etc.</td><td>Collectibles, games, real estate, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Representative Projects</td><td></td><td>NFT Worlds, BAYC, CryptoKitties, Hashmasks</td><td>OpenSea Shared Storefront, Rarible</td><td>Aavegotchi</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Source：Organized from Tianfeng Securities, PANews</p><p>It can be seen that, from left to right, after the homogenized token has developed into a non-homogeneous token, the emergence of more new protocols has brought new capabilities and gameplay to NFTs, which also makes NFTs more than just rights and interests. prove.

There is no doubt that with the development of smart contracts, NFTs will have more and more ways to play, and their functions will become more and more powerful, but no matter how it changes, its core is always the concept of ownership. Digital assets and even the data itself can tell the world through NFT technology who a digital asset "belongs" to, but due to the lack of current digital property legislation, it may be more appropriate to describe it as "all tokens".</p><p>Around the concept of all tokens, the extended role and value of NFTs, I summarize it into the following aspects.</p><h2 id=1-ownership-tokens-themselves><a href=#1-ownership-tokens-themselves class=anchor-link><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon anchor-icon"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96.0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7.0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757.0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037.0 01-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482.0 0120.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96.0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454.0 0020.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037.0 00-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639.0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"/></svg></a>1.

Relying on NFT technology, users' identities can be decentralized and used on different platforms; at this stage, people's on-chain identities are basically wallet addresses, but the amount of information and application scenarios recorded by wallet addresses are far from enough. Moreover, the wallet addresses on different chains cannot be aggregated to form identity data, and the user's "identity information" cannot be fully presented at present, which requires the maturity of cross-chain technology.</li></ol><h2 id=2-ownership-tokens--defi><a href=#2-ownership-tokens--defi class=anchor-link><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon anchor-icon"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96.0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7.0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757.0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037.0 01-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482.0 0120.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96.0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454.0 0020.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037.0 00-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639.0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"/></svg></a>2. Ownership tokens + DeFi</h2><p>There are countless financial scenarios derived from ownership, and almost all scenarios in the real world can be NFTized. Projects from DeFi to NFTs have begun to show great development potential. One of the typical applications is lending.</p><p>Lending, this form is very likely to become the next explosion in the field of decentralized finance. If the market allows users to lease their NFT assets as loan collateral, allowing other users to use other people's NFTs on their own platforms, this will unlock the endless potential of NFTs, which will not only further clarify the valuation of NFTs, It also provides more liquidity.

Ownership Tokens + P2E (Play to Earn)</h2><p>The earliest landing attempt of NFT was in games. NFTs based on blockchain technology can record the status and achievements of players in the game, and save the list of items obtained in the game. NFTs can ensure immutable and seamless transfer of records, guaranteeing ownership verification and authenticity of game items. At the same time, game items can also be designed to be used across games, or have a certain exchange value. The problem with traditional games is that these items are not allowed to be transferred, and few games allow the trade or sale of collected items, let alone use across games. NFTs provide a solution to this problem. Allows in-game assets to be transferred to other games. At present, there are two main types of blockchain game play, namely GameFi with centralized characteristics and decentralized Meta game.</p><ol><li><strong>GameFi</strong></li></ol><p>This mode is one of the most popular and popular scenarios for NFT application projects, with use cases including Axie Infinity, Alien Worlds, NBA Top Shot, Sorare, etc.</p><p>In mid-2021, the sales of NFT game Axie Infinity skyrocketed. According to CryptoSlam data, as of December 9, the cumulative transaction volume of NFT game project Axie Infinity exceeded 3.6 billion US dollars, ranking first in the NFT market in terms of transaction volume. The rapid rise of Axie Infinity has driven the rapid development of the entire NFT market sector.</p><ol start=2><li><strong>Meta game</strong></li></ol><p>The representative of the metagame is undoubtedly the decentralized Loot. Its founder is Dom Hofmann. Loot has the following four characteristics: 1. Directly receive coins in smart contracts; 2. Bottom-up community Drive mode; 3. Novel shape and simple design; 4. Large space for subsequent imagination. The most important significance of Loot is that it provides an example of decentralized NFT, adopts a community-driven bottom-up model, and transfers the creation rights of NFT from the project side to the community, which truly stimulates the great creativity of the community.</p><p>Another great example is Rarity, which was created on Fantom by its founder, Andre Kroger (AC). Strictly speaking, Rarity can be seen as an imitation of Loot. Loot has 8 equipments, Rarity has 11 adventure characters, and the subsequent gameplay is decided by the developer. We see the role of Rarity as a kind of game atom, where members of the community write games together.</p><p>Rarity differs from Loot in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Rarity is based on Fantom instead of Ethereum;</li><li>Rarity casting without restrictions;</li><li>Rarity is more centralized under AC.</li></ul><p>As of October 14, more than 4 million characters have been minted by more than 170,000 holders.

Ownership Tokens + C2E (Create to Earn)</h2><p>Advances in AI will transform Play-to-earn into Create-to-earn. The Create-to-earn model, which brings new services to players through virtual creation, is mainly achieved through creators providing value-added services to players. Creators gain real-world benefits by being able to create virtual reality. Under the economic incentives, the creation of users is stimulated, which is dominated by player creation, bringing immersive experience and social scenes, and has seen the prototype of the metaverse.</p><p>This mode mainly includes:</p><ol><li><strong>ART</strong></li></ol><p>NFTs allow artists to own the copyright of their own artworks, and buyers can ensure the authenticity and authority of the artworks they buy, preventing piracy and counterfeiting. Blockchain can solve the proof of ownership problem. Artists no longer have to rely on third parties for protection of their works, eliminating the medium of middlemen and ensuring more income for artists. The tokenization of digital art makes it easier to create, trade, and earn royalties from NFTs. Due to the catalysis of the epidemic and other reasons, this form has become one of the scenarios with the most NFT application projects, and its subdivision forms include star cards/digital art, avatar OG, generative art, etc.</p><p>Among the top 5 projects by transaction volume in the NFT market, 2 to 4 are art projects, namely CryptoPunks, Art Blocks, and Bored Ape Yacht Club. Major platforms include OpenSea, MakersPlace, SuperRare, KnownOrigin, Mintbase, Nifty Gateway, Rarible;</p><ol start=2><li><strong>MUSIC</strong></li></ol><p>The NFT marketplace promises to open up a world of virtual collectibles to music fans. In the K-pop realm, many fans have embraced the NFT collectible format—independently released albums are highly sought after. Musicians can create digital goods to sell, and they can decide how many versions are made available in perpetuity before the work is released to the market. Not only can NFT platforms bring sales to musicians, they can also bring in better revenue than music platforms such as Spotify and iTunes. Use cases include Rocki, Rarible, Mintbase, etc.</p><ol start=3><li><strong>FASHION</strong></li></ol><p>NFTs related to the fashion industry can also be put into use on the Ethereum blockchain network, launching projects. More and more tools and technologies will be rolled out to allow designers and developers to collaborate on virtual clothing materials, shapes, and interoperable game and VR fashion assets. Startup Digitalax, for example, launched the world’s first NFT protocol for the digital fashion industry — and it’s confident it can bring these cutting-edge digital assets into the mainstream. Digitalax is the first dedicated purely digital fashion auction trading platform and open source digital fashion toolkit.</p><ol start=4><li><strong>KNOWLEDGE</strong></li></ol><p>The current content production and distribution model based on the Web2.0 model fails to effectively protect the interests of creators. There are two economic benefits to decentralizing creators:</p><ul><li>transfer content ownership from traditional internet platforms to creators;</li><li>Create a revenue stream for long-tail creators.</li></ul><p>Like Mirror, it is a decentralized content distribution platform where creators raise money from fans by issuing tokens. After their works are minted into NFTs, the income from article reprints and rewards will be shared with fans according to their contributions, and creators need to open columns through WRITE tokens.</p><p>In addition, in the academic world, several centralized publishing institutions in the Web2.0 era monopolized the copyright of academic papers, and even the publishers of academic papers even need to pay for downloading their own papers after the papers are published. In the era of Web3.0, scholars can publish their papers on the blockchain. Combined with NFT to protect their copyrights and intellectual property rights, people anywhere in the world can access their academic achievements for free, which not only reduces the barriers to academic exchanges , it can also promote academic equity, and academic institutions in many poor countries are now struggling to pay for expensive paper downloads.</p><h2 id=5-ownership-token--ip--fan-economy><a href=#5-ownership-token--ip--fan-economy class=anchor-link><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon anchor-icon"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96.0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7.0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757.0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037.0 01-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482.0 0120.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96.0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454.0 0020.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037.0 00-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639.0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"/></svg></a>5. Ownership Token + IP / Fan Economy</h2><p>Whether in P2E or C2E mode, NFTs are inseparable from the community. In both cases, people gather for play or creation. In addition to this, there is another force that attracts people to form active communities, and that is IP.</p><p>The value of NFTs has strong content and media attributes. One of the very important dimensions is the audience's acceptance of the NFT. This is exactly the same as the popular IP in the traditional entertainment field. Whether the IP is popular also depends on whether it can obtain large-scale group identity.</p><p>Through fans' recognition of idols (IP), idols are given value and accumulated, so as to further shape a business model that can generate economic benefits and form a fan economy. The NBA Top Shot, which recently set a transaction record of 400 million US dollars, is such a strong IP-based NFTs that makes full use of the business logic of the fan economy. In addition, use cases in this regard include Sorare, which focuses on football IP, and Starly, which is doing Instagram for Web 3.0.</p><p>The above are the five role scenarios of NFTs. Of course, these application scenarios of NFTs do not exist in isolation. For example, the concept of all tokens C2E and the concept of ownership IP will be integrated to a large extent.

It is worth mentioning, however, that ownership is a legal concept as old as human civilization. In law, property is "the right to enjoy and dispose of things in the most absolute manner", and when it comes to your house, it's clear that you bought it - it's your absolute property. There are two types of tangible property (such as house, car, etc.) and intangible property (such as intellectual property).</p><p>The law does not specify that mere data or information can be protected by intellectual property rules so that it can be "owned" by someone. In a democratic society, information and data, like ideas, flow freely, and data itself is not something that can be appropriated or "owned." It is likely that some common law systems are flexible enough to extend the application of property law to certain types of information-only cryptoassets, but reconciling this concept with freedom of speech and information enshrined in international conventions23 seems comparable difficulty.</p><p>Without legislative intervention, the absence of information property rights will continue to pose thorny issues for digital asset stakeholders.</p><p>Another challenge posed by using NFTs to "sell" limited licenses or rights to use certain digital artworks is - how to effectively "attach" contracts/terms and conditions to NFTs so that NFT buyers (and future purchasers) are bound by it.</p><ol start=2><li>There is currently no means to prevent counterfeiting</li></ol><p>There is currently no way to determine who is the real human creator of a piece of art by looking at the data contained in an NFT. The result is an increasing number of cases of NFT forgery, in which scammers create NFTs and present them as the work of a particular well-known artist. A quick Google search on the topic reveals that NFT forgery is a rapidly growing problem. In some cases, scammers take an image/photo of a real work of art created by an artist, convert it into an NFT, then pretend to be the artist and sell the NFT.</p><ol start=3><li>Storage is not safe and stable enough</li></ol><p>NFT creators can choose two ways to store metadata on-chain and off-chain. On-chain storage costs are high and traffic is congested, but metadata will exist permanently with the token. Off-chain storage restrictions are small, but metadata exists in theory. risk of loss. At present, the solutions available for off-chain storage include centralized data storage, IPFS, and decentralized cloud storage.</p><p>Centralized storage is obviously not a good approach, the original file may be lost or corrupted, but even if the data is stored on IPFS, it is possible that only one node hosts the content and no other nodes back it up, if the storage Its only node is disconnected from the network and data may become unavailable. The Memo project is trying to use the developed MEFS system to make up for this deficiency of IPFS. Also, an NFT may point to a wrong file address. If this is the case, the user cannot prove that he actually owns the NFT. All in all, relying on an external system as the core component of an NFT system is fragile.</p><ol start=4><li>The technology is not mature enough to cause security problems</li></ol><p>The technology behind NFTs is only a few years old and still hasn't reached maturity. This has led many to question the security and authenticity of NFTs. This is mainly due to the crackability of smart contracts. The recent frequent incidents of hackers stealing assets have constantly reminded people that the security issues of NFT technology cannot be ignored. In addition, the lack of sufficient technical foundation and economic infrastructure, as well as the scalability of blockchain technology, have affected the mainstream use of NFTs.</p><h1 id=the-future-direction-of-nft><a href=#the-future-direction-of-nft class=anchor-link><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon anchor-icon"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96.0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7.0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757.0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037.0 01-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482.0 0120.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96.0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454.0 0020.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037.0 00-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639.0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"/></svg></a>The future direction of NFT</h1><p>NFT is too simple, it just performs a digital confirmation.</p><p>NFT is too complicated, and everything can be NFT, which means that it has countless ways to play. This way of playing is to move the real world into the virtual world. This step sounds simple, but there are indeed many difficulties to overcome, and the road is long.</p><p>At present, NFT is only a carnival for a few people, and its most popular, most participated and most funded areas are still concentrated on art collections. This is still an economic model that gathers traffic and attention, such as The influence and appeal of a celebrity like Elon Musk is enormous. As Tesla CEO, he has driven and influenced the direction of the digital asset market many times, whether it was Dogecoin before or more recently. PEOPLE. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has also cast his eye on NFTs, auctioning off his “first tweet” NFT to charity for $2.9 million.</p><p>However, if the focus of NFT is still on these people, then NFT may lose its real social influence. There is little real social value in adding $1 million to a celebrity like Elon Musk by selling NFTs.</p><p>However, I firmly believe that NFTs are revolutionary because the essence of NFTs is a revolution in ownership.</p><blockquote><p>"Ownership is undoubtedly the most basic concept in society. All forms determine the character of each society, and its form of existence is also the basis for the division of times such as primitive communist society, slave society, feudal society, capitalist society, and socialist society." — - "The Birth of "Ownership" Masanobu Kato</p></blockquote><p>I can't predict what the impact and change that NFT can ultimately achieve in this society, but whatever it is, I think it can be called a revolution.</p><p>This is essentially a distant and bold speculation about NFTs, so what is the direction of NFTs in the near future?</p><blockquote><p>"I'm not sure how big the bubble of a single NFT in the market can go, but I know that there is still a lack of reliable and universal NFT infrastructure. NFT trading platforms, developer tools, community-oriented business models, and decentralized identity Management/credit management systems are still in their infancy. These core infrastructures will be one of the hottest areas of investment in 2022." - "Crypto Theses for 2022" from Messari</p></blockquote><p>I very much agree with Messari's point of view. At present, the NFT field is full of bubbles and opportunities, and the problem that NFT still has is the opportunity for NFT. In addition to the first point I mentioned in the previous section, it takes time for NFT to gradually attract the attention of the entire real society and establish supervision, the other three points are inseparable from the infrastructure construction of NFT.</p><p>First, prevent counterfeiting problems. This can not only start with smart contracts, there are many things that can be done from NFT trading platforms. In addition to this, the investment value of the NFT trading platform also benefits from the "bubble" of NFT. It is foreseeable that the use of NFT as a supporting technology for digital collections in a short period of time is still one of its main value functions. With NFT sweeping the art, music, fashion and content worlds, NFT trading platforms are bound to usher in a wave of positives. These fields all rely on creations. In this process, the trading platform that can solve the problem of counterfeiting will inevitably win the game.</p><p>Second, storage issues. Relying on an external system as a core component of an NFT system is vulnerable, even though the Memo project is trying to use the developed MEFS system to make up for the shortcomings of IPFS. The ultimate solution is to store NFTs directly on the blockchain, but there are still many problems due to this storage method, such as high fees, very low confirmation speed, anonymity and privacy issues. If these problems can be solved, the value of NFTs can truly be brought into play, and projects that solve these problems will inevitably be valued.</p><p>Again, security issues. Although the core of this problem is the smart contract, a complete contract design that is difficult to be broken by calculation is far from being completed by the human brain alone. If developer tools can focus on this point, it will solve one of the core problems of NFTs, and NFTs that solve security problems will truly symbolize ownership. In addition, with the current explosion of NFT projects, a convenient and available one-stop developer tool that integrates multiple functions will inevitably be sought after, which is also in urgent need.</p><p>In addition, not to mention the recent popularity of DAOs, the community-oriented (DAO) business model deserves attention. For centralized identity management/credit management, in <a href=https://messari.io/research/mason-nystrom target=_blank rel=noopener>Mason Nystrom</a> "<em>[Curation Tokens: Examining the Types of Crypto Curation](https: //messari.io/article/curation-tokens-examining-types-of-crypto-curation)</em>", proposes that NFTs such as NFTs will play an integral role in porting real-world certificates and identities to the new world the role of such a view. I agree with it very much, but I think that this day will not come too soon if the three core issues just now are not resolved. Real-world certificates and identity certificates, as active and important information proof materials for users, are important in fidelity, storage and security. On the issue, there is no room for loss. There may be small-scale and experimental applications in the early stage, but large-scale social applications will take time. This is not only a technical issue, but also involves regulatory compliance. Perhaps the alliance chain is the real landing scenario for this application.</p><p>In addition, the recent fire of GameFi. In my opinion, it may not be a good choice to invest in specific game projects. Behind the popularity of Axie Infinity, there are not only the general environmental reasons for the epidemic, but also professional community promoters and the environment of countries with a large number of idle labor such as the Philippines. Just because one game is successful doesn't make all game projects full of confidence. The most attractive point of GameFi is that players can make money. This model has already appeared in legendary games around 2000. For players, it is not so important to sell NFT-based game equipment, even if it can bring another game. . There are many factors that affect whether a blockchain game can really become popular. In addition to the ability to make money, other factors such as playability, community operation, stability and bandwidth are all factors to be considered. However, it is a good choice to jump out of GameFi itself and invest in platforms that support GameFi game projects. They can increase the efficiency of new game projects and improve the innovation ability of game projects. For example, rct AI is a good choice. Additionally, gaming guilds like the Good Games Guild and development tools like Stardust are great investment options.</p><p>Finally, I will focus on the contribution of NFTs to the data market, which I think is one of the most promising applications of NFTs, although it has not received enough attention. The NFTization of data assets is one of the most important links in the transformation of the entire society from financial capital into the era of data capital. According to the International Data Corporation, while the amount of "potentially useful" data doubled from 20% to 40% from 2012 to 2020, less than 1% of the world's data is actually used and analyzed. The data analytics market will balloon to nearly $100 billion by the end of next year, with companies and users looking to better monetize their data. In Web3, protocols such as Ocean provide a wrapper for these data packets by encouraging public sharing and secure monetization of data and better price discovery through liquid data markets.</p><p>Although data as a means of production is the main competitive advantage of many companies, such as advertising revenue and marketing profits involving FAMGA and domestic BATTMD, there are many stakes, but even so, the revolution brought by NFT to the data market is still inevitable of. It is not difficult to argue this point, as Victor Mayer-Schoenberg, the father of big data, has argued and emphasized in his new book, The Age of Data Capital, that our economy is about to shift from financial capitalism to data capitalism era, and the most critical issue in this era is to protect data markets from excessive concentration, not only at the level of participants, but also in the decision-making process.</p></div></article><div class=post-share><div class=share-items><div class="share-item twitter"><a
