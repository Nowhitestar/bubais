Data generation, collection and storage</h1><p>Public data, personal data and legal entity data are mostly generated in our daily use of computer applications, among which personal data and legal entity data are most relevant to ordinary users. So how is personal data and legal entity data generated and collected? A highly abstract Internet product system architecture diagram is shown below.</p><p><img src=https://s2.loli.net/2022/08/19/JLAQjYiv8zVhtl9.png alt="Web2 Application Architecture"><span class=caption>◎ Web2 Application Architecture</span></p><p>The bottom-level database stores the data passed from the back-end and generated by the interaction between the user and the front-end. Broadly speaking, these are user data. As far as mobile applications are concerned, data can be roughly divided into the following categories:</p><ol><li><strong>User information</strong>, the user-related information recorded by the user using the application service, including the user's identity information, device, network, geographic location and even the list of applications installed on the mobile device, etc. Buried to collect.</li><li><strong>Content data</strong>, the data generated by the user using the application service, these include any non-personal information content data that the user actively interactively writes on the application, which are part of the application service and are generally collected directly by the server data sheet.</li><li><strong>Behavior data</strong>, the data generated by the user's interaction during the use of the application, these include the user's behavioral habits during the use of the application, such as viewing time, click rate, penetration rate, sliding situation, etc., which are generally collected by buried points .</li><li><strong>Log data</strong>, the data generated by the application itself during the user's use of the application, these include the application's crash log, etc.</li><li><strong>Code data</strong>, non-user interaction data includes front-end and back-end code. Like user data, these data are stored on a centralized server somewhere.</li></ol><p>In this category, user information belongs to personal information data, and log and code data belong to legal entity data. Among them, content data and behavior data are worth discussing. In the Web2 era, they are more divided into their own business data by centralized entities, that is, legal person data.</p><p>Is there any difference in the application of Web3? Preethi Kasireddy's <a href="https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/the-architecture-of-a-web-3-0-application?ref=tokendaily" target=_blank rel=noopener>Web3 Product Architecture</a> can help us understand.</p><p><img src=https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ddd80927946cdaa0e71d607/614bb2efff06e818e12a57f2_Screen%20Shot%202021-09-22%20at%206.49.04%20PM.png alt="Web3 Product Architecture Source: Preethi Kasireddy"><span class=caption>◎ Web3 Product Architecture Source: Preethi Kasireddy</span></p><p>Compared with Web2 applications, the user terminal and front-end are almost unchanged. The difference lies in the backend and the database. Users interact with node providers through the front end (rather than a centralized server), access contract code deployed on blockchains such as Ethereum (rather than the backend environment on the server), and interact. In this process, the above-mentioned types of data will also be generated. Due to the difference in technical architecture, the data generated by Web3 is not stored by a centralized server, and the storage methods of data generated in different ways may have similarities and differences.</p><p>All the data generated by the interaction of smart contracts are published on the blockchain and can be accessed by anyone. Therefore, it becomes a public product, including asset information, transaction data and contract codes.

This is because the current storage infrastructure is not perfect, the project party is either limited by technical problems, or has adopted a centralized solution to ensure access speed. With the continuous development of infrastructure, there are many more and more powerful storage infrastructures, such as IFPS, Stroj, Filecoin and Ceramic, etc., and more and more applications have begun to deploy themselves on decentralized storage, such as Deploy the front-end website on IPFS and then access it through ENS, so as to build a decentralized website front-end, and use Arweave to perpetuate file data such as pictures corresponding to the NFT project, and so on.</p><p>In general, when building a Web3 application, developers usually have 3 options for storing application data:</p><ol><li>To store it on the blockchain, this option is very expensive, it will make the application as simple as possible, and the data is completely open.

This term is an inescapable topic when we talk about the characteristics of Web3, generally including data sovereignty and application sovereignty. So is sovereignty important? This is another topic, which is not discussed in this article. Interested can refer to related articles, such as <a href=https://mirror.xyz/0x31Ae182A31Bb2c3cfd9e2E3732cc53f7606FB773/C1XwiABsyQ5-AKUCJVa4PyuEOwPe8hX-hsVXAqZfSJ4 target=_blank rel=noopener>"Web3 Data Market Outlook"</a> and <a href=https://mirror.xyz/0xCD28A8eC501a0dDe7b27cC46965ceB7C3B35e1B7/UfvwrDOP8R6JsEotTc4n3rB8LxNa0tcLiYEx_f4C4zo target=_blank rel=noopener>"Web3 - Let the " right to data "awaken"</a>. Here I want to cut into the only way to establish Web3 sovereignty from the perspective of data, and deduce the direction and focus of infrastructure development.</p><p>Regarding data sovereignty, it includes digital asset sovereignty and user data sovereignty. "<a href=https://mirror.xyz/bubai.eth/SzPjJLhZeRBmwuTFKxL8MG3HcWqmLYstqSHGCuY9rc4 target=_blank rel=noopener>Vertical Liquidity: How Value Interconnects</a>" The article talks about how tokens can define the user's digital asset sovereignty (identity, relationship and property rights) , which is determined by a broad consensus that is hard to tamper with. Most fundamentally, the definition of these rights can be done by the blockchain itself, such as which address a token belongs to. But once it comes to the ownership of more complex digital product rights, there will be many problems, a typical one is the storage problem of pictures (or articles, etc.) corresponding to NFTs, "[NFT: Revolution of Digital Ownership](https:// This issue is discussed in mirror.xyz/bubai.eth/KAgr16vN8IRtjHARFQ6Wx35OmgLj9Oh2qcRkiiNw_OE)". The status quo of most NFTs is that their digital counterparts are stored on a centralized server somewhere, [once the server crashes or gets hacked](<a href=https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions target=_blank rel=noopener>https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions</a> .html) , then all the user has is a string of on-chain hashes, and the real "item" behind the hash can be stolen or replaced at any time, making it worthless.</p><p>In addition, user data sovereignty, as one of the most obvious dividing lines between Web2 and Web3, is a banner for the innovation and progress of Web3. In this regard, Ceramic envisions a <a href=https://blog.ceramic.network/into-the-dataverse/ target=_blank rel=noopener>data universe</a>, a composable, web-scale data ecosystem owned by everyone but not Unique to anyone. User data follows the user from one app to another, and the user acts as the hub to control their own digital universe. At present, there are almost no applications that can achieve this, Cyberconnect has made a good attempt, <a href=https://mirror.xyz/cyberlab.eth/Rqr8tiXed6helt5LfSotEdLFxB6Kv_fA1Poz3K_6g0c target=_blank rel=noopener>it creates a decentralized social graph protocol</a> Interoperability between users' social relationship data. But at present, the application does not guarantee the data sovereignty of users, although they have begun to transfer to Ceramic for construction, but everything is still on the way.</p><p>Regarding application sovereignty, some people refer to sovereign applications as "<a href=https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html target=_blank rel=noopener>hyperstructures</a>", which are unstoppable, free, valuable, scalable, permissionless, positive externalities and Features such as trusted neutrality, which combine to provide a public good in the digital world, creating the infrastructure of the "metaverse" (if you believe it). At present, most of the so-called Web3 applications do not have a high degree of application sovereignty, they are not real public goods, they can be easily sanctioned and changed by power, [tornado cash incident](<a href=https://home.treasury.gov/news target=_blank rel=noopener>https://home.treasury.gov/news</a> /press-releases/jy0916) very directly illustrates the problem. One of the main reasons is that although the contract codes of these application protocol layers are published on the blockchain, components such as front-end and domain names are still controlled by third-party centralized entities.</p><p>In order to realize data sovereignty and application sovereignty, the construction method of Web3 applications is very important. The basic starting point is storage. Where does the data exist, and how can it be stored to ensure that users can have sovereignty? In general, depending on the user's data type, there can be different solutions:</p><ol><li><strong>Users' asset information and transaction data should be public ledger data</strong>, and it is most important to ensure verifiability on the chain, but it is very important for applications such as Aztec to appear to ensure the privacy of users' transactions on the chain. worth.</li><li><strong>Users' user information, content data and behavioral data are regarded as personal information</strong>, and it is very important to ensure the user's right to control. With the user's consent, these data can be selectively disclosed as public goods to discover positive results. externality.</li><li><strong>Log data and code data are used as legal person data</strong>, privatization is acceptable and necessary, but when it comes to Web3 infrastructure applications of the "super building" category, it should have the characteristics of public infrastructure. Features, the storage of application code should be open and have the ability to resist censorship beyond the platform level.</li></ol><p>At present, the reason why most Web3 applications adopt "storage of smart contract logic on the blockchain, and others on the traditional backend" is that there is currently no good enough decentralized infrastructure to replace the original centralized infrastructure solution.</p><p>First, decentralized storage such as IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave are static storage, which makes them lack computing and state management capabilities, and cannot implement more advanced database-like functions (such as mutability, version control, access control, and programmable logic). ), and although Ceramic is dynamic storage, which solves these problems to a certain extent, the current access speed of Ceramic is still relatively slow, the development kit is not perfect, and its degree of decentralization has been criticized.</p><p>The main function of decentralized storage such as IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave is to statically store unstructured data such as pictures, documents, and static codes. Because of its hard-to-tamper characteristics, it guarantees digital data such as NFT to a certain extent. Sovereignty, once the link between the on-chain hash code and the off-chain storage address is established, it is difficult to be influenced by external forces in extraordinary ways. The front-end code is built on it, which also promotes the integrity of application sovereignty. However, since the storage technology at the current stage is only storage, the lack of computing power has led to its functional support far behind the centralized server solution.</p><p>The current mainstream decentralized storage situation on the market is shown in the following table, the data is from CoinmarketCap, August 23, 2022.

Data management</h1><p>Building Web3 applications on decentralized storage makes them less susceptible to external interference, breaking monopoly and power. However, storage alone is not enough. It also requires the support of technologies such as rendering computing, data processing, permission configuration and privacy protection in the storage environment to ensure the sovereignty of applications and the data sovereignty of users, so as to realize the personalization of the digital world. The rise of sovereignty. Especially access control and privacy protection issues, they should be implemented with a high-level sovereign technical solution. These levels of data in Web2 applications are stored on some specific centralized servers according to different security protection levels. Their security is guaranteed by network security, and their sovereignty is guaranteed by platforms (such as enterprise platforms, government platforms, etc.) . In this data management mode, users are subordinate to the super administrator, and the user has no rights to the data itself; in addition, data security is also subject to the centralized entity of the super administrator, such as the <a href=https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1543700689611792386 target=_blank rel=noopener>public security data leakage incident in a certain area some time ago</a>, a super administrator leaked his private key, leaking the personal private information of hundreds of millions of people.</p><p>Web3 data management should have the following two characteristics:</p><ol><li>Data sovereignty guarantee. This should go beyond the platform level or even the world level, and ensure the common rights of users in the digital world through world-class consensus. The guarantee in the traditional world is platform-level, and the rules come from non-consensus. A platform-level company can control all the rules and regulations and can change them at any time, thereby infringing on the individual sovereignty of users at any time.</li><li>Data Privacy Guarantee. The privacy and security of user data is mathematically guaranteed through cryptography, not through database network security. Selective encryption controlled by users is one of the basic rights of user data sovereignty.</li></ol><p>How Web3 data is managed depends on how the data is stored.</p><div class=table-container><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:left>Project Name</th><th style=text-align:left>Technical Foundation</th><th style=text-align:left>Consensus Layer</th><th style=text-align:left>Management Mode</th><th style=text-align:left>Privacy Protection</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:left>IPFS</td><td style=text-align:left>IPFS</td><td style=text-align:left>None</td><td style=text-align:left>Content Centric</td><td style=text-align:left>None</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Filecoin</td><td style=text-align:left>IPFS</td><td style=text-align:left>Yes</td><td style=text-align:left>Content-Centric</td><td style=text-align:left>Third Party Project Support</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Ceramic</td><td style=text-align:left>IPFS</td><td style=text-align:left>None</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Arweave</td><td style=text-align:left>Blockchian</td><td style=text-align:left>Yes</td><td style=text-align:left>Perpetual, trackable uploader</td><td style=text-align:left>Third-party project support</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:left>Stratos</td><td style=text-align:left>Blockchain</td><td style=text-align:left>Yes</td><td style=text-align:left>Balance of the two, dynamic adjustment</td><td style=text-align:left>Third-party project support</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>IPFS and Filecoin are content-centric, access stored content through Content ID (CID), and build third-party applications for data management on this basis, such as through [ChainSafe Files](<a href=https://filecoin.io/zh target=_blank rel=noopener>https://filecoin.io/zh</a> -cn/blog/posts/chainsafe-files/) , after the single sign-on problem can be solved in a localized way, the data can be encrypted and stored easily through asymmetric encryption. The content-centric management model makes user management difficult, and how to assign data ownership becomes more complicated. In addition to providing storage, Filecoin's ecological scalability will be much higher than other underlying layers. Especially after the launch of FVM, there may be some special tools for some vertical fields of data storage and data retrieval, which can help users to help enterprises better manage some of their data and ensure data. security, and then develop a lot of some new applications.</p><p>Ceramic is also based on IPFS, but is user-centric, built on the IDX Protocol, <a href=https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/advanced/standards/accounts/3id-did/ target=_blank rel=noopener>3ID DID</a> method (CIP-79) With the Ceramic-native account system, it can be used to authenticate Ceramic. Users can use the blockchain wallet to control the 3ID DID to execute transactions on the data stream and manage their own data. This is achieved by associating the DID with the data and storing it in the data model. The data model defines the schema of the user data, which is shared by all applications using the same data model.</p><p>Arweave is a one-time, permanent storage decentralized data storage project on the chain. The data is openly and transparently stored on the chain, and anyone can access it. The data stored on the chain can be browsed through the Arweave blockchain browser. The data management in this mode is exactly the same as the data on the management chain. There is no access control and "hot update" of the original data. Every time the data is updated, its index address will change. There is no problem with IPFS and Filecoin. However, the advantage is that it is very clear to which user the data belongs, which is conducive to backtracking of data rights and interests.</p><p>Stratos is also a storage based on blockchain consensus. It will maintain an index tree specifically to record the path of data storage, so as to keep track of data updates. Different from Arweave, each storage node (Resource Node) of Stratos is designed to have computing power, storage and content access control services at the same time. The project party will build a database based on the blockchain itself for dynamic data throughput.

Such a data model market is achieved through an urgent consensus on a data model, similar to the ETC contract standard in Ethereum, from which developers can choose as a function template to have an application that conforms to all the data for that data model. For now, such a market is not a trading market.</p><p>Regarding the data model, a simple example is that in a decentralized social network, the data model can be simplified into 4 parameters, namely:</p><ol><li><code>PostList</code>: Stores an index of user posts</li><li><code>Post</code>: store a single post</li><li><code>Profile</code>: store the user's data</li><li><code>FollowList</code>: Store the user's follow list</li></ol><p>So how can data models be created, shared and reused on Ceramic for data interoperability across applications?</p><p>Ceramic provides a data model registry ( <a href=https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels target=_blank rel=noopener>DataModels Registry</a> ), an open source, community-built, reusable application data model for Ceramic repository. Here, developers can publicly register, discover, and reuse existing data models—the basis for customer-operated applications built on shared data models. Currently, it is based on Github storage, and in the future it will be decentralized on Ceramic.</p><p>All data models added to the registry are automatically published under the <code>npm</code> plugin package at <strong>@datamodels</strong>. Any developer can use <code>@datamodels/model-name</code> to install one or more data models, making these models available to store or retrieve data at runtime using any IDX client, including DID DataStore or Self.ID.</p><p>In addition, Ceramic also built a <a href=https://github.com/ceramicstudio/datamodels/discussions target=_blank rel=noopener>DataModels Forum</a> based on Github, each model in the data model registry has its own discussion thread on this forum, the community It can be used to comment and discuss. It is also a place for developers to post their ideas on the data model to solicit community input before adding it to the registry. At present, everything is in the early stage, and there are not many data models in the registry. The data model included in the registry should become a CIP standard through the evaluation of the community, just like the smart contract standard of Ethereum, which provides a possibility for data. compositionality.</p><h3 id=oceans-data-trading-market><a href=#oceans-data-trading-market class=anchor-link><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon anchor-icon"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96.0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7.0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757.0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037.0 01-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482.0 0120.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96.0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454.0 0020.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037.0 00-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639.0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"/></svg></a>Ocean's data trading market</h3><p>Ocean Protocol has established a decentralized data service supply chain network with the data trading market as the core.

There are endless data analysis tools and indexing tools. The huge gold mine of on-chain data has been fully tapped. Most of them are on-chain data mining, and only a few involve off-chain data. In general, the data usage link is an ETLA (Extract, Transform, Load, Analysis) process, and each node has representative items. The representative of the Extract project is The Graph, the representative of the project of the Transform (Transform) into a usable data table and the Load (Load) link is Dune and Luabsae, and the representative of the Analysis (Analysis) is Nansen and NFTGO.</p><p>On the other hand, in decentralized storage, ETLA's entire process of supporting projects is almost a desert, with only some extraction projects, and there are huge opportunities and challenges here. ** The Graph and the Ceramic community themselves are working on extracting the data on Ceramic, the founder of Orbis also tried to make a <a href=https://cerscan.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Cerscan</a> for browsing the data on Ceramic. Arweave can already read and manage the data stored in Arweave with subgraphs through The Graph, and there are also related third-party projects on Filecoin doing this. However, the process of TLA is still unknown. The biggest reason is that the data stored in different decentralized storages is highly heterogeneous, and it is difficult to have a unified model to mine the value of these data. Among them, the most promising This step is Ceramic, because the existence of its advanced data model reduces the heterogeneity of data on Ceramic exponentially, thus making the data more available. **</p><p>In addition to on-chain data, there are many projects trying to connect on-chain data and off-chain data. Such projects can be regarded as "chain reform" projects. Type classifications are:</p><ol><li>Web2 data sovereignty and trading market: <a href=https://dev.to/itheum/itheum-data-dex-whitepaper-ooo target=_blank rel=noopener>Itheum</a>, <a href=https://www.nvg8.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Navigate</a> , <a href=https://swashapp.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Swash</a> and <a href=https://www.getphyllo.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Phyllo</a> etc. This type of project mainly combines traditional Internet data with data on the chain, hoping to open up the information exchange between Web2 and Web3. Common practices are to export Web2 data and import it into a designated data pool or directly bind traditional Internet social accounts, etc. .</li><li>Enterprise data consensus: <a href=https://authtrail.com/blog/authtrail-101-with-ceo-matjaz-sobocan/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Authtrail</a>, this project integrates with the internal database of the enterprise and joins the consensus layer to achieve Tamper-proof and traceable data within the enterprise.</li><li>On-chain and off-chain data combination: <a href=https://www.spaceandtime.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Space and Time</a>, this project will integrate off-chain databases like Authtrail, but there is no consensus layer, more on-chain In addition, <a href=https://www.pooldata.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Pool</a> is also doing similar things.</li></ol><p>The usage paradigm of Web3 data is significantly different from that of Web2, which mainly lies in the way data is aggregated, that is, different types of data are stored, indexed, extracted, integrated and utilized in different ways. According to the previous classification, here are some brief summaries:</p><ol><li>Public data: including public data and some legal person data classified in the "Guidelines for Cybersecurity Standards Practice - Guidelines for Data Classification and Grading". As a public product, it is data that can be publicly mined for value. Access does not require permission, but user ownership can be traced to trace airdrop profits. Typical examples are on-chain data and non-encrypted application data stored in decentralized storage. (such as user posts, likes and comments, etc.). The most important upstream support for its use is for indexing applications, such as The Graph, or applications for Web3 native databases, such as Tableland.</li><li>Private data: including personal information and some legal person data classified in the "Guidelines for Cybersecurity Standards Practice - Guidelines for Data Classification and Grading". As a data type that requires encrypted storage and certain privacy permission configuration, its access has permission and cannot be publicly obtained. If it is stored in decentralized storage and blockchain, permission-configurable encrypted storage is required. Or through other means, such as privacy technology means such as ZK, MPC and TEE. The most important upstream support for its use is database applications such as Kwil and Ceramic.</li></ol></div></article><div class=post-share><div class=share-items><div class="share-item
