Unlike the overwhelming news coverage of topics like artificial intelligence and big data, there is little media attention to zero-knowledge technology. Nonetheless, the technology is still a great breakthrough, bringing valuable privacy guarantees to this era of big data where personal information has nowhere to hide.</p><p>Zero-knowledge cryptography is a broad topic, but in this article, we will only focus on one area most relevant to blockchains: zero-knowledge proofs. A zero-knowledge proof is a non-interactive, zero-knowledge proof of knowledge that assumes two parties: a prover and a verifier. The prover wants to prove to the verifier that they know some information without revealing what it is. At the same time, the validator will look at the proof and accept or reject it. These schemes have three properties:</p><ol><li>Integrity - any valid result can justify a given program</li><li>Robustness - no dishonest actor can create valid proofs</li><li>Zero knowledge - the verifier knows nothing about the <em>input</em> of the proof, only the result</li></ol><p>In the realm of blockchains, which are publicly visible on all data chains, this proof of a statement without revealing its truth is a powerful primitive. Whether for individuals, enterprises or governments, this technology can solve many real pain points, such as <a href=https://zeroknowledge.fm/zero-knowledge-cryptography-the-next-digital-revolution/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Protecting user data, designing sensitive systems or contracts, proving fairness in the distribution of public goods, and enabling more efficient and economical government agencies</a>。</p><p>In the field of blockchain, in addition to privacy protection, the most eye-catching application is ZK Rollup, the expansion scheme of Ethereum. <a href=https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698 target=_blank rel=noopener>Ethereum is currently embracing a rollup-centric scaling solution</a>, it represents the optimal trade-off between decentralization, security, and scalability. Essentially, the Ethereum upgrade will make the network more scalable, sustainable and secure.</p><p>The expansion plan of Ethereum is divided into on-chain expansion and off-chain expansion.</p><p>On-chain scaling technology is an upgrade to the base layer of the blockchain to improve scalability. Ethereum's long-term on-chain scaling solution is called sharding, which actually splits the base layer into 64 chains with shared security secured by the beacon chain.</p><p>Off-chain scaling refers to scaling solutions that use an external execution layer instead of the base layer. These Layer 2 or "L2" are auxiliary layers that sit on top of the base layer and provide more transactional capabilities to the entire blockchain. The L2s solution embraced by Ethereum is Rollup, which can bring the following features:</p><ol><li>With roll up, Ethereum can go from about 25 to 3,000 TPS without sacrificing security;</li><li>With roll up, user funds cannot be stolen or censored (as is the case on some sidechains);</li><li>Users can always access data on L1, and no one can prevent users’ funds from safely withdrawing from the roll up at any time.</li></ol><p>There are two (main) types of rollups in current solutions: ZK Rollup (ZKRU) and Optimistic Rollup (OR).</p><h2 id=optimistic-and-zero-knowledge-method-comparison><a href=#optimistic-and-zero-knowledge-method-comparison class=anchor-link><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon anchor-icon"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96.0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7.0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757.0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037.0 01-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482.0 0120.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96.0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454.0 0020.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037.0 00-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639.0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"/></svg></a>Optimistic and Zero Knowledge method comparison</h2><p>Optimistic Rollup is a more mature solution than ZKRU. Products from Optimstic and Arbiturm are already available to Ethereum developers. However, due to the use of the fraud proof mechanism, its withdrawal time and security are currently debatable, and its cost optimization is slightly inferior to ZK. The weaknesses of ZK Rollup are basically technical problems. With a large number of excellent developers investing in related research, most people including Vitalik agree that ZK Rollup will be a better expansion solution in the future. Comparing the two, <a href=https://w3hitchhiker.mirror.xyz/7dwD76ZZIlR7ep731K6y9vTTuXGHOojxWSnkXKzqPzI target=_blank rel=noopener>the gas cost and TPS of each solution are as follows</a>：</p><p><img src=https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1h2bizskocfj216u0n4q78.jpg alt=untitled><span class=caption>◎ The cost of each of the four methods Source: Xiang｜W3.Hitchhiker，The premise of the above calculation is that the current Eth price is 2500u, the block gas limit is 30000000, the gas cost is 30Gwei, and the average block time is 13 seconds. The limit TPS refers to the corresponding operating environment occupying all Ethereum block space (in the proof verification Costs 500,000 gas), ordinary TPS means that the corresponding operating environment occupies 1/3 of the block space of all Ethereum.</span></p><p>In terms of efficiency and cost, the ZK scheme is more efficient than the OR scheme, with higher TPS and lower costs.</p><p>In terms of time cost, and due to the fraud proof mechanism, withdrawals on Optimtisc Rollup require a submission period of 7-14 days for others to falsify potential malicious behavior, although there are already Optimstic Rollup solutions such as Boba Network. Proposed liquidity pool mechanism to reduce withdrawal period.</p><p>In terms of compatibility, both Optimistic and ZK face the problem of accommodating complex EVM contract invocation operations, but Optimistic is easier to achieve this. OR solutions including Arbitrum, Optimism have EVM-compatible virtual machines, allowing them to process all transactions on the main chain of Ethereum.</p><p>One of the main issues limiting the development of ZK Rollup is EVM compatibility. At the beginning of the EVM design, the developer did not expect to use ZK technology in the future. Therefore, it is almost impossible to generate usable zero-knowledge proofs through EVM operations, thus giving rise to the need for ZK-EVM. So far there is no publicly available ZK-EVM solution. However, the zkSync 2.0 public testnet was officially launched at the end of February, which is also the first EVM-compatible ZK Rollup on the Ethereum testnet. Perhaps the large-scale practical use of ZK Rollup will come sooner than we expect.</p><blockquote><p>Why is EVM compatibility so difficult for ZK?
Most of the existing ZK Rollup solutions can only support simple payment and swap scenarios. The reason is that zkEVM not only needs to normally execute the bytecode of the smart contract, but also needs to generate a Proof to indicate that the state has been updated correctly after the transaction is reached. It’s difficult for the two to be compatible due to t<a href=https://hackmd.io/@yezhang/S1_KMMbGt target=_blank rel=noopener>he design of EVM and the algorithm principles of ZK Proof</a>.</p></blockquote><p>In terms of security, the security of OR comes from economics where a reasonable incentive mechanism must be designed to drive a group of verifiers on the main chain to monitor the submitter at any time and be ready to submit fraud proofs. The submitter, on the other hand, must pay the price for the evil node by staking. Meanwhile, the security of ZK comes from mathematics or cryptography which can be trustless. The guarantees provided by mathematics and cryptography are far more reliable than the optimistic belief that human nature cannot be evil.</p><p>In comparison, the <a href=https://mirror.xyz/0x3D5FE39342e661776bb5273521F52E99B624288c/NFOsWYCb2eVk612VSnrrCsoKcwI_EMObp_q9uNKa4uA target=_blank rel=noopener>pros and cons</a> of ZK Rollups are as follows:</p><p>PROS</p><ul><li>Less data contained in each transaction increases the throughput and scalability of L2 with the benefits of greater scalability and reduced transaction costs compared with Optimistic Rollups;</li><li>There is no need for anyone to monitor ZKR;</li><li>Do not require a dispute window like Optimistic Rollups, which can reduce the withdrawal time from about two weeks to minutes;</li><li>Privacy is enabled by default.</li></ul><p>CONS</p><ul><li>The difficulty in computing zero-knowledge proofs will require data optimization to get maximum throughput;</li><li>Initially setting up and integrating into the Ethereum network is more difficult than Optimistic Rollups.</li></ul><p>Relatively speaking, the weaknesses of ZK Rollup are basically technical issues. It is believed that these problems will be solved as a large number of outstanding developers are devoting themselves to relevant research. Most people including Vitalik agree that ZK Rollup will be a better scaling solution in the future.</p><h1 id=what-is-the-landscape-of-the-zk-rollup-scalability-solution><a href=#what-is-the-landscape-of-the-zk-rollup-scalability-solution class=anchor-link><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon anchor-icon"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96.0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7.0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757.0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037.0 01-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482.0 0120.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96.0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454.0 0020.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037.0 00-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639.0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"/></svg></a>What Is the Landscape of the ZK Rollup Scalability Solution?</h1><h2 id=zk-rollups-players-comparison><a href=#zk-rollups-players-comparison class=anchor-link><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon anchor-icon"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96.0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7.0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757.0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037.0 01-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482.0 0120.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96.0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454.0 0020.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037.0 00-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639.0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"/></svg></a>ZK Rollups Players Comparison</h2><p>There are two major players in the ZK Rollup technology area: <a href=https://twitter.com/zksync target=_blank rel=noopener>zkSync</a> and <a href=https://twitter.com/StarkWareLtd target=_blank rel=noopener>StarkWare</a>。</p><p>Some of the <a href=https://news.ethereum.cn/Layer2/zksync-vs-starkware target=_blank rel=noopener>major differences</a> between the two players in terms of team, technology, data availability, financing and supporters, current products and roadmaps are shown directly in the table below.</p><div class=table-container><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>StarkWare</th><th>zkSync（Matter Lab）</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Team</td><td>Established in May 2018.

StarWare have more academic professionals. Its team is composed of world-class cryptographers and scientists who have been pioneers and innovators in the zero-knowledge field for many years. They have published many academic papers, which are in the process of turning into a real-world product, StarkWare. Meanwhile, there is not much information about zkSync team. From the product launch, it’s indicated that the team is cross-professional and highly efficient.</p><p>Technology. StarkWare is still a better choice. It provides blockchain finality, which means it has the optimal capital efficiency. Besides, the <a href=https://www.geekmeta.com/article/3421070.html target=_blank rel=noopener>main advantages</a> of STARK are as follows:</p><ol><li>1.StarkWare invented and built its own ZK-STARK system, while zkSync’s technology stack was built by someone else (PLONK, built by Aztec). This also means that StarkWare is more capable of mastering and improving technology.</li><li>StarkWare already has several systems running in the production environment, which use a Turing-complete programming language called Cairo, which is readily available; while Matter Labs has only one simple payment system in the production environment, and no Turing-complete language is available.</li><li>StarkWare is faster, more secure (in a cryptographic sense), transparent (no trust settings required) and post-quantum secure; while the core technology used by Matter Labs (built by another team) is slower, requires trust settings, and can be breached by quantum computers.</li></ol><p>Data availability (DA). StarkWare invented the Volition system to solve DA problems. Volition allows end-users to choose between the rollup solution (on-chain data availability) and the validium solution (off-chain data availability) for each transaction. ZkSync uses the zkPorter technology based on Volition. The main difference between Volition and zkPorter is: in the Volition solution, users can choose the data storage method based on each transaction, while in zkPorter solution, users can choose the transaction settlement method based on each account (zkPorter accounts can only be accessed through off-chain data-available ways to make transactions). In addition, zkPorter’s off-chain DA system is more decentralized, because its DA is motivated by Guardian, actuated by zkSync native tokens to provide security, rather than a centralized “DAC”.</p><p>Financing and supporters. StarkWare is valued at 2 billion USD and is in the process of raising a Series D funding worth approximately 6 billion USD. This is a world-class financing process, attracting many famous investors. Some tycoons and members of Ethereum Foundation have been involved. Vitalik itself has also reviewed most of the articles published by StarkWare. Compared with StarkWare, zkSync has fewer prominent investors, and it looks like large-scale DeFi/CEX encrypted family financing. Each of these projects is well-recognized, and together they can form a good ecosystem. It’s important to note that the success of ZK Rollup will depend heavily on the addition of the DeFi protocol and the direct integration with CEX.</p><p>Current products and roadmap. In June 2020, StarkWare first launched StarEx, which represents the “Planets” phase of their roadmap and allows the creation of permissioned, application-specific ZK Rollup supported by Cairo and STARKs, such as <a href=https://twitter.com/dydxprotocol target=_blank rel=noopener>dydx</a>, <a href=https://twitter.com/Immutable target=_blank rel=noopener>Immutable</a>, <a href=https://twitter.com/deversifi target=_blank rel=noopener>Deversifi</a>, <a href="https://sorare.com/?action=signin" target=_blank rel=noopener>Sorare</a>. They are the four main applications supported by the production version of StarkEx. As of March 2022, StarkEx has processed 134 million transactions, and its cumulative transaction volume amounts to $490 billion and the Total Value Locked hit $1.1 billion.</p><p><img src=https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1h2bj0upigbj20iw097jry.jpg alt="StarkWare 路线图 来源：StarkWare"><span class=caption>◎ StarkWare Roadmap Source: StarkWare</span></p><p>On November 29, 2021, they released the Alpha version of the mainnet of StarkNet, which is rapidly moving towards the “Constellations” phase of the roadmap. StarkNet is the general ZK Rollup that we expect to be permissionless and multi-application. As of March 2022, the StarkNet testnet Goerli has generated 1.4 million transactions and 45,000 were made on the mainnet. In terms of contract deployment, there are 26,000 contracts on the testnet Goerli and 1,600 contracts on the mainnet.</p><p>Initially, StarkNet will be driven by a centralized prover, and applications will need to apply for a whitelist to be deployed sequentially, just like what Optimism did. They plan to develop the ecosystem and gradually decentralize StarkNet to achieve the “Universe” phase of the roadmap.</p><p>The roadmap for zkSync can be summarized as the following 4 steps. The first phase corresponds to the zkSync 1.0 launched in June 2020, which is roughly equivalent to a ZK Rollup without smart contract integration. Users can send and receive tokens but this lacks composability. Many promising projects have been already deployed on zkSync 1.0.</p><p><img src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wn63t_kZgq73Qtgrzt0JR.png?height=206&amp;width=837" alt="zkSync 路线图 来源：Matter Lab"><span class=caption>◎ zkSync Roadmap Source：Matter Lab</span></p><p>The second phase of the roadmap started with the launch of zkSync 2.0 on the mainnet, which includes everything we expect: a fully EVM-compatible ZK Rollup with smart contract composability. zkSync 2.0 was initially planned to be launched on the mainnet in August but was delayed due to <a href=https://blog.matter-labs.io/zksync-2-0-developer-update-d25417f16446 target=_blank rel=noopener>some technical difficulties</a>. These issues are now being tested on the testnet and are gradually being resolved. In October, zkSync revealed some of its recently completed technical details and deployed an AMM-like testnet (uniswap) to verify its EVM compatibility. To ensure the compatibility of LLVM/Solidity, Matter Labs delays its launch, which may sound depressing at the beginning. However, it will help every Ethereum tool to achieve local integration on zkSync 2.0.</p><h2 id=advantages-of-zk-rollup><a href=#advantages-of-zk-rollup class=anchor-link><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon anchor-icon"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96.0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7.0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757.0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037.0 01-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482.0 0120.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96.0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454.0 0020.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037.0 00-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639.0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"/></svg></a>Advantages of ZK Rollup</h2><p>The ZK Rollup solution can bring <a href=https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/r7cNMWYPP-9sqjLcKz64Aw target=_blank rel=noopener>unique advantages</a> such as privacy protection, scalability preserving and cross-chain application implementation.</p><ol><li>Privacy is one of the advantages and features of ZK Rollup.</li></ol><p>Permissionless blockchains can achieve computational completeness without trusting third parties, but they come at a cost in terms of scalability and privacy.

Previously, it was difficult to build generic DApps mainly due to the following two reasons.</p><ul><li>First, if you want to develop DApp on ZK Rollup, you are required to write all your smart contract logic in a special language (i.e. <a href=https://tlu.tarilabs.com/cryptography/r1cs-bulletproofs/mainreport.html#rank-1-constraint-systems target=_blank rel=noopener>R1CS</a>). The syntax of the required language is complex. Furthermore, you have to possess comprehensive expertise in zero-knowledge proofs.</li><li>Second, ZK Rollup does not support composability, which means different ZK Rollup applications cannot interact with each other on L2. This quality greatly undermines the composability of DeFi applications.</li></ul><p>There are two ways to build a generic DApp in ZK Rollup. One is to build application-specific circuits (ASIC) for different DApps, which is the path taken by ZK Rollup in its early stages, corresponding to the “Planets” phase of StarkWare where applications cannot interact with each other. The other way is to build a general “EVM” circuit for smart contract execution, on which StarkWare and zkSync have made great progress.</p><p>The development of StarkWare is in the “Constellations” phase for the time being. In September 2021, StarkWare announced the launch of the general ZK Rollup that is permissionless, multi-application, and supportive to smart contracts through Cairo. Meanwhile, the development of zkSync is also in the second stage. In February 2022, the zkSync 2.0 testnet was launched. Continuous testing ensures LLVM/Solidity compatibility for full EVM compatibility and smart contract composability.</p><p>Note: StarkWare and zkSync adopt two completely different technology solutions.</p><p>StarkWare uses <a href=https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-alpha-2-4aa116f0ecfc target=_blank rel=noopener>Cairo, a brand new Turing-complete programming language</a>, and works with OpenZeppelin to develop standardized contracts, just as they did with Ethereum, which means they adopt a new contract standard for composability. It’s certainly a bold decision, as it will significantly increase the entry cost for developers. For now, Nethermind’s Warp team <a href=https://medium.com/nethermind-eth/warp-your-way-to-starknet-ddd6856875e0 target=_blank rel=noopener>is helping</a> developers convert ERC-20 contracts from EVM bytecode to StarkNet contracts and deploy them on StarkNet. The project is progressing rapidly, and its next goal is to move arbitrary smart contracts from Yul to Cairo.</p><p>On the other hand, <a href=https://mirror.xyz/kuiqian.eth/FW6gE79ksYDgfrDOhW9zse-bGhLBzaMizIlid3iKZ8Q target=_blank rel=noopener>zkSync uses zkEVM solution for EVM compatibility</a>. For zkEVM, there are two major implementation strategies at the moment.</p><ul><li>Directly supports the existing set of EVM opcodes, which is fully compatible with the set of Solidity opcodes. This strategy is used by Hermez and the Ethereum Foundation zkEVM.</li><li>Maintaining Solidity compatibility by redesigning a new virtual machine that is ZKP-friendly and adaptive to EVM development tools. This strategy is mainly used by zkSync.</li></ul><p>Overall, the first strategy has better compatibility and higher security, but needs more work, which is used by Hermez; the second strategy is more flexible with less work but requires extra effort in adaptation, which is used by zkSync. zkSync has developed two compiler front-ends for zkEVM at the same time: Yul and Zinc. zkSync chose LLVM to build its own compiler. The LLVM/Solidity compatibility issue is the major reason behind the <a href=https://blog.matter-labs.io/zksync-2-0-developer-update-d25417f16446 target=_blank rel=noopener>failure to launch</a> zkSync 2.0 as scheduled in August 2021, which is also the issue that is currently being focused on during the launch of the zkSync 2.0 testnet.</p><p>Using Cairo makes StarkWare seem to be less compatible. Is this the weakness of StarkWare? It is not.</p><p>StarkWare uses the Cairo language to port the smart contract logic to Rollup. Although the new language somewhat increases the entry cost for developers, many features of Cairo allow ZK to integrate more elegantly into the blockchain ecosystem.For example, Cario has an accompanying Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR) visualization tool to view the details of proofs, securely and credibly generate zk-STARK proofs to ensure computational completeness, and the language is designed to be neater and more logically in line with mathematical proofs, and it has a complete tool chain as well.</p><p>In addition, Cairo also <a href=https://medium.com/starkware/hello-cairo-3cb43b13b209 target=_blank rel=noopener>increases security</a>. Cairo’s AIR is relatively simple, which leads to low efficiency and low amortized costs for both the on-chain verifier and the off-chain proving service. Besides, auditing a single simple AIR is safer than auditing multiple complicated application-specific AIRs. As a result, with Cairo, we can rely on a single Verifier smart contract; there is no longer a need to deploy a Verifier for every application used.</p><p>Note the security implication of this property: a single set of audits for this one contract protects any application from the proof system risk since it only audits the business logic.

ZkSync has 1,300 stars, slightly higher than Optimism’s 900 stars and Arbitrum’s 700 stars.</li><li>When it comes to the number of protocol developers on Github, Optimism comes in first. zkSync has 43 developers, Optimism 66, and Arbitrum 36.</li><li>When it comes to the number of protocol forks on Github, Arbitrum has a slightly higher number of 355, while the forks of zkSync and Optimism are quite close, being 292 and 303 respectively.</li><li>When it comes to TVL, Arbitrum is far ahead with $3.41 billion at present, while zkSync and Optimism stand at $148 million and $562 million respectively.</li></ul><p>In comparison, the more successful Ethereum “alternative chain” Solana has 7,700 Github stars, 1,800 forks, 305 contributors and a TVL of $7.46 billion.</p><p>It can be seen that the present Rollups are far from being called a market winner, and there is still a lot of work to be done. The most important is to get more project integrations, since more adoption will attract more developers, thus building better eco-projects, getting more users and attracting more funding.

It can be seen that zkSync is supported by more cross-chain, DeFi and wallet applications, while there is a more prosperous Games & NFTs ecosystem on StarkWare.</p><p>For an L1s/L2s ecosystem, <a href=https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/liquidity-is-bandwidth target=_blank rel=noopener>liquidity is equivalent to bandwidth</a>, connecting different application scenarios to form a larger network, i.e. the Internet of Value. The definition of liquidity over here is the value exchange between different applications. When liquidity is good, there is less value loss; and when it is poor, there is more value loss. In addition, when there is no value exchange between different applications, there is no liquidity. An ecosystem is only functioning when its liquidity can run through the whole process, like the Ethereum ecosystem where every application based on Ethereum can be valued and exchanged through Ethereum.</p><p>I divide the liquidity in the ecosystem into horizontal and vertical liquidity. In L2s, the role of the bridge is to bridge between different Rollups horizontally. Recently, there is an innovative way called LayerZero, which innovates the liquidity bridging way of traditional bridges and brings better security and trustlessness. The vertical liquidity mainly lies in different applications. End Users connect to the whole ecosystem through Wallet. Sometimes they top up and buy cryptocurrency through Payment to get value and exchange value in different applications. Sometimes intermediate exchange is required through Marketplace apps.</p><p><img src=https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1h2bj2v0ef5j20ma0f9q3p.jpg alt="L2 生态价值流动图"><span class=caption>◎ L2 Eco-value Flow Diagram</span></p><p>At present, in each liquidity node, StarkWare and zkSync have corresponding applications deployed, most of which are in the testing phase, and their ecosystems are compared in the chart below.</p><p><img src=https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/e6c9d24egy1h2bj34ji7lj21gx0u0gtw.jpg alt="zkSync 和 StarkWare 生态对比 来源：ZK_Daily"><span class=caption>◎ zkSync and StarkWare Ecosystem Comparison Source: ZK_Daily</span></p><p>Go to Community (Ecosystem), first of all, needs to be able to open up vertical liquidity internally, which requires support for composability so that there is a unified standard in the ecosystem that enables permissionless mutual integration between different application protocols just as Lego blocks. This is easy to do on Ethereum, but due to the zero-knowledge proof issue, both StarkWare and zkSync have worked very hard to solve this problem.</p><p>The prerequisite for a vibrant community (ecosystem) is to have good horizontal liquidity, which requires the support of useful bridges that can bridge the liquidity of Ethereum at a low cost and, more importantly, can easily communicate with other L2 solutions or even L1 solutions. A fast (high TPS), low cost (low fees) and secure blockchain are naturally attractive for both applications and users. The lower the migration cost, the more attractive the ecosystem is to both applications and users.</p><p>The necessary condition for a community (ecosystem) to take off is the emergence of the killer app that draws a large number of users and capital in. This cannot be achieved only through high APY, token airdrops or subsidies and a closed “play to earn” ecosystem.</p><h1 id=how-to-invest-in-scaling-ecosystem><a href=#how-to-invest-in-scaling-ecosystem class=anchor-link><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon anchor-icon"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96.0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7.0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757.0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037.0 01-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482.0 0120.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96.0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454.0 0020.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037.0 00-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639.0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"/></svg></a>How to Invest in Scaling Ecosystem</h1><p>Blockchain is the Internet of Value, while the traditional Internet is the Internet of Information; Information data is transmitted by bandwidth, while value exchange is undertaken by liquidity. The first thing that the public chain ecosystem needs to achieve is the flow of value, followed by the efficient exchange of value. Then, based on the efficient exchange of value, productivity increased by establishing applications that meet the needs of users, and finally a blockchain world created featured in efficiency, permissionlessness and censorship resistance, endowed with democratic and anti-vice mechanisms that are open inclusive and transparent.</p><p>Thanks to smart contracts, the blockchain application is not only limited to being a decentralized ledger but also generates new things such as Non-fungible Token for ownership definition in the digital world and DAO, a new governance organization structure with homogeneous tokens as the cornerstone of governance. These innovations, combined with existing Internet applications, have given rise to more application scenarios, but the current blockchain infrastructure is not well equipped to support the implementation of these application scenarios.</p><p>First is the issue of scaling. Both TPS and data availability need scaling. This has been explored by ZK Rollup and Validium and their work has been productive. In addition, there are other Layer 2/Layer 1 solutions such as Optimistic Rollup, Plasma, Solana and Celestia. Scaling technology itself is the best investment target. At this stage, we can put more attention to the on-chain storage technology. After scaling, high TPS and reliable data availability can greatly improve the performance of the blockchain, which allows more complex applications to be built on the blockchain. These applications can be divided into two categories: Internet product blockchainlized and Blockchain original innovation.</p><ul><li>Internet product blockchainlized: The most obvious examples are the applications in the GameFi field, such as GameFi on-chain real-time matchmaking settlements, on-chain real-time communication and large-scale payments.</li><li>Blockchain original innovation: High-performance blockchain infrastructure allows more frequent and intensive value exchange behavior than before, which will greatly promote the cost-efficiency of value flow. Innovative applications should be those that can truly improve the efficiency of capital utilization and thus achieve higher productivity. Moreover, high-performance blockchains make it possible to achieve <a href=https://www.amazon.com/%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E8%B5%84%E6%9C%AC%E6%97%B6%E4%BB%A3-%E6%89%98%E9%A9%AC%E6%96%AF%C2%B7%E6%8B%89%E5%A7%86%E4%BB%80-Thomas-%E7%BB%B4%E5%85%8B%E6%89%98%C2%B7%E8%BF%88%E5%B0%94-%E8%88%8D%E6%81%A9%E4%BC%AF%E6%A0%BC-Mayer-Sch%C3%B6nberger/dp/B07KLFLYH9 target=_blank rel=noopener>data capital market</a> liquidity, which is a groundbreaking innovation that allows data, as a factor of production in the information age, to flow and be applied fully, with reasonable and fair benefit distribution.</li></ul><p>Next is the issue of liquidity, which is divided into horizontal and vertical liquidity here.</p><ul><li>Horizontal liquidity refers to the transfer of value among different public chains/L2 ecosystems. When a new public chain/L2 ecosystem is formed, users need a good value exchange tool, sometimes called a bridge, to migrate from the original ecosystem. Currently, traditional bridge tools have some security issues, which may lead to the loss of users' money and sometimes even trigger chain effects. The good news is that there are new bridge technologies, such as Layerzero, and it is believed that there will be more and better technologies, such as zk bridges which are expected to <a href=https://hackmd.io/@kalmanlajko/rkgg9GLG5 target=_blank rel=noopener>solve many problems</a> about bridges currently exist. Bridges, as a liquidity portal of ecosystem’s value, can generate more DeFi applications thus capturing more value.</li></ul><p><a href=https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1511342937262759939 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1511342937262759939</a></p><ul><li>Vertical liquidity refers to the transfer of value within the same L1/L2 ecosystem. The optimization of vertical liquidity contributes more to the efficient flow of value, thanks to various innovative DeFi applications including AMM, Yield Farm and Lending. Efficient applications result in less value loss in the exchange process and the value captured in this segment is undoubtedly huge. However, the current solutions are not good enough, as most of them provide liquidity by locking it, which is not an efficient way to use funds. Novel solutions in this area include Tokemak and dAMM, and we can look out for more L2 applications in this area.</li></ul><p>The third is the issue of data privacy. No company wants to make all its financial data public so that the whole network can audit its every financial flow. The blockchain on-chain data is in the HTTP era of the Internet, where all information is “transmitted” in clear text, while the emergence of ZK technology can make the blockchain embrace the HTTPS era. It can be believed that almost every transaction on the blockchain in the future can be protected by zero-knowledge technology. At that time, blockchain technology will be able to penetrate every corner of society and protect privacy of transactions while ensuring trustlessness, tamper-proof, openness, security and transparency. The best way to guarantee privacy is in the form of a protocol, serving as a plug-in, which can be built together with other protocols like Lego blocks, and it can be configured, owned and censorship-resistant. In the foreseeable future, the privacy protocol will be mandatory for every application.</p><p>Lastly, the wallet plays a crucial role as the gateway to the blockchain world. If compared with the Internet, wallet is like the browser in the Internet era. Information interacts with people through the browser, but value interacts with people through the wallet. It is said that we have entered the Netscape era of blockchain, and MetaMask may be the Netscape that flourished back then, although their endings may be different. However, I think the wallet is far from being good at this moment. One of the most important points is that value does not flow efficiently between different wallets. There may be some compatibility issues that affect interoperability here, but undoubtedly, we need a universal set of standards to define this value interface.</p><p>The mentioned above is the infrastructure, the area where value is created and begins to be captured. Only after these issues are improved (which may not be exhaustive) will blockchain technology be able to take off and the Internet of Value be able to connect everyone.</p><p>Inside the previous public chain ecosystem, the value was mainly captured by protocols, firstly in the public chain itself, and then in the DeFi field, especially in exchanges and exchange platforms. Here we can refer to the famous <a href=https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Fat Protocol Theory</a>, which has always been <a href=https://messari.io/article/analyst-notes-cracks-in-the-fat-protocol-theory target=_blank rel=noopener>debatable</a>. For the moment, however, Fat Protocol Theory is generally correct. In my opinion, this is because the blockchain infrastructure era is still far from over.</p><p>Infrastructure construction is long, difficult and labor- and material-intensive, but it is the area with the most notable moat effect. On top of the infrastructure, applications that can bring great benefits are called kinetic applications, and those that create the most value effects must be kinetic applications. To be the infrastructure or the kinetic application is not unchanging, for example, Taobao, once the kinetic application of the Internet, but now serves as a platform that is gradually becoming the infrastructure of Ant Group. The core purpose of infrastructure is to pave the way for kinetic applications and reduce the adoption cost of kinetic applications.</p><p>The kinetic age of blockchain has not yet arrived, and as it does, there is no doubt that the Fat Protocol Theory will fail (although some problems have already emerged). At this moment, it would be wise to bet on the infrastructure track that can reduce the cost of application adoption. The adoption cost includes not only economic costs, but also efficiency, technology thresholds, and even belief costs (reflected in blockchain fundamentalism such as decentralization, trustlessness, and censorship resistance).</p><p>With the gradual application of ZK Rollup in the L2 era and even <a href=https://medium.com/starkware/fractal-scaling-from-l2-to-l3-7fe238ecfb4f target=_blank rel=noopener>the arrival of the era of L3 and L4</a>, the kinetic era of blockchain will surely become predictable. So who is the leading role in the kinetic era? It must come from areas that could emerge killer applications. These areas include games, entertainment, social networks and virtual reality. Early betting in these areas is also a desirable investment. However, given the difficulty and return ratio, it is not very cost-effective at this stage. When investing in these areas, you can fully consider whether they make full use of the new infrastructure or retain full scalability for the new infrastructure, which enables fast enough,high-value cost control and efficiency improvements. It will greatly improve their competitiveness in the rapidly evolving blockchain infrastructure era.</p><h1 id=references><a href=#references class=anchor-link><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" class="icon anchor-icon"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96.0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7.0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757.0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037.0 01-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482.0 0120.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96.0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454.0 0020.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037.0 00-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639.0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"/></svg></a>References</h1><p><a href=https://zeroknowledge.fm/zero-knowledge-cryptography-the-next-digital-revolution/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Zero Knowledge Cryptography & the Next Digital Revolution -
