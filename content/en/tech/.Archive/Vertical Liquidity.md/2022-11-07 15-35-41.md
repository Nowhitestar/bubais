Some people call the blockchain the value settlement layer of the Internet, so Web3 based on blockchain technology is called the Internet of Value. The blockchain itself, as a distributed ledger, is closely associated with "value". Its [basic value](https://cryptobriefing.com/why-bitcoin-how-money-works-today/) is embodied in Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and with the invention of smart contracts, people have discovered Its potential is much more than that. Blockchain technology constructs a brand-new trust system, so that anything with "value" can be transferred between networks.

The high degree of decentralization of the blockchain makes it difficult to tamper with, and the global consensus recorded on the decentralized ledger is where all value is generated.

A smart contract is a code published on the blockchain. Due to the characteristics of a decentralized ledger, it is also difficult to tamper with, but it can be upgraded to a certain extent. Smart contracts solidify code constraints on the blockchain, and through global consensus, make everyone abide by the same set of governance logic. Open source free and unified standards creatively make smart contracts composable, and value is connected from then on.

Tokens often refer to data units written on the blockchain defined by a contract standard. Through composability, it cooperates with other smart contracts to achieve ownership definition, profit distribution and other purposes through global consensus, thereby financializing the scene, thereby realizing multi-party governance and coordination in the scene, and exchanging value accordingly.

# The carrier of value flow

The value flow carrier of Web3 is the basic element supporting the entire network value flow. According to the different levels of abstraction, we divide it into three layers. The bottom layer is the medium of exchange and value storage, which is the medium of value flow; the second layer is identity, relationship, and property rights, which defines the social trust. Basic structure; the top layer is decentralized organization and society, etc., which undertakes new human collaboration methods based on the second layer.

## Medium of exchange and store of value

Fungible Token (FT) is the most direct value as [Store of Value](https://cryptobriefing.com/why-bitcoin-wealth-transfer/) and [Medium of Exchange](https://cryptobriefing.com/why-bitcoin-wealth-transfer/) vitalik.ca/general/2017/10/17/moe.html). As a value recorded on a distributed ledger, scarcity is the basis for it as a store of value, and a steady stream of buyers and sellers is the reason for the continued value of the token, and illiquid money is worthless. Therefore, as a medium of exchange, not all homogenized tokens are valuable. What needs to be established here is not only a literal global consensus based on the ledger, but also a global consensus based on psychological utility. This psychological utility, also known by some as [internal coordination](https://mirror.xyz/0xe7175fe936E9AfdEb0CACe5b88E45CEe3387ffb8/RLDoHJMElSOVPVFtVmQsgtsWCw96C1ulhPsnQGZlIhQ), describes how digital media as a whole reflects the internal & organic content verification system of.

> It is the opposite of the hype-driven, narrative-driven, meme market. The main driver of investment interest is distributed peer-to-peer learning. The more memes are marketed and promoted, the more people call crypto a Ponzi scheme. But the deeper the content clues and thought snippets, the more outsiders and onlookers believe in its value.

A typical example of this is ETH. At this stage, the mission of BTC is more of a better store of value, while ETH has slowly become the hard currency of the blockchain world. What makes this happen is not hype, narrative, and memes, but a content consensus around ETH’s distributed peer-to-peer learning. The ETH ecosystem is constantly building and developing, producing more and more utilities, such as smart contract standards, Ethereum login, and more. At the same time, as one of the most influential KOLs in the blockchain world, Vitalik continues to lead the innovation of blockchain ideas, from [blockchain governance](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting. html) to [Extended Endgame](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html) and then to [Soul Binding](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/ 26/soulbound.html) etc. The ethereum souls represented by Vitalik have a very high influence in driving industry cognition and ideological improvement. These in-depth content clues and thought fragments make the outside world full of confidence in the value of ethereum.

The value flow as a homogenized token, either as a pure medium of exchange like Bitcoin, or with various utilities like Ethereum, or as a pure stable currency like USDT for online circulation.

Bitcoin's model is The Store of Value Hypothesis (SoV). The SoV system design can be simple and useless but needs to be strong and stable. Flow in the Internet of Value in the form of a value storage medium. This flow can be slow and low-frequency, and performance is not its first consideration. It needs to have world-class autonomy, censorship resistance, and security. This type of monetary asset is also Monero, Zcash, etc.

The Ethereum model is The Utility Hypothesis. The utility system design needs to pursue performance and functions. It is based on smart contracts and is oriented to solve real problems in real life or the network world. These utilities include, but are not limited to, transaction throughput, speed, privacy, price stability, contract flexibility and programmability, and more. Likewise, it is pursuing world-class autonomy, censorship resistance, and security, although some believe this can be compromised. This type of monetary asset also includes Bitcoin Cash, SOL, BNB, and more.

USDT falls into the category of the utility hypothesis, which needs to maximize the utility of price stability. Its biggest feature is that it turns electronic currency into encrypted currency, so as to achieve platform-level and even world-class resistance to censorship. Anyone, anywhere, anytime, as long as they can connect to the network, can always have legal currency (such as US dollars) forever. Equivalent cryptocurrency. This impact is far-reaching. In the traditional world, there are various restrictions and obstacles in exchanging national currencies into legal currencies such as the US dollar. Stablecoins break these restrictions and make currency circulation more free. This is a highly potential scenario. This type of currency also includes USDC, DAI, BUSD, and more.

## Identity, relationship and property rights

Blockchain will be the only source of truth in the digital world. Tim Sweeney of Epic Games has publicly stated that the metaverse can only exist if there is a true digital native property rights system, and the blockchain is providing such underlying capabilities. In the book Inevitably, Kevin Kelly states that "We cannot prevent free copying on a large scale. Doing so would not only destroy the dynamics of wealth creation, it would bring the Internet itself to a standstill. Free-flowing copies are already on the Internet. The nature of this global communication system has left its mark. Network technology requires unconstrained replication. Replicas must flow.”

Reproduction of the digital world is inevitable, it is part of the nature of the Internet. The Internet adds value to free replicas through [native](https://www.woshipm.com/pd/454843.html) so that they become commodities that can be sold, and blockchain through global consensus provides Originally free copies define property rights and derive definitions of identity and relationship.

The technical means to achieve these include Non-Fungible Token (NFT), Soul Bound Token (SBT) and Decentralized IDentify (DID).

NFT is [a revolution in digital ownership](https://mirror.xyz/bubai.eth/KAgr16vN8IRtjHARFQ6Wx35OmgLj9Oh2qcRkiiNw_OE), it is defined and "minted" by smart contracts, cannot be copied and tampered with, and can be used as physical collectibles and images, music, games The "digital fingerprint" of virtual assets such as props. It defines the property rights, relationships and identities that can be exchanged. People can purchase NFTs of encrypted art works to declare their sovereignty, purchase PROOF Collective or BAYC to obtain membership in the corresponding clubs, enjoy corresponding value-added services, and can also purchase StepN’s running shoes NFT to Owning a pair of digital running shoes, you can use it to "run" and get corresponding rewards, etc. However, identity, relationship, and property rights are not all tradable, and they cannot define the totality of social ownership.

[SBT](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) implements the definition of non-tradable ownership, which is the gateway to a [decentralized society](https://papers.ssrn .com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763). Identities and relationships such as personal contributions, positions, and skill certifications are non-tradable and describe a person's abilities, experiences, and identity as much as they describe a person's "soul". It has many application scenarios, such as wallet's [social recovery](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html), skill certificate, on-chain unsecured lending, decentralized governance, etc. . Combined with NFTs, they make it possible for everyone to disaggregate, trade, share, and own rights in the digital world.

DID defines the identity of an individual in the digital world. It is the basic component of the sociality of the digital world. It makes the flow of value not only stay at the financial level, but also extends to the social credit level. Lacking a native Web3 identity, today's DeFi ecosystem cannot support activities that are ubiquitous in the real economy, such as undercollateralized loans, or simple contracts like apartment rentals. SBT is a small step in creating this kind of social identity, composability and [the construction of composite meaning](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) is what DID can apply to the ground The essential. Composability requires a unified standard, and the construction of composite meaning includes predictive models based on user data, composite artificial intelligence, and programmable composite privacy.

The digital construction of identities, relationships, and property rights is far-reaching, allowing Web3 to transform society broadly, not just the financial system. All social structures today can thus be built in the digital world and avoid witch attacks, collusion and material over-financing.

## Decentralized Organizations and Society

The improvement of social trust level [conducive to economic development](http://www.shkxjk.com/CN/abstract/abstract3675.shtml), its [influence mechanism](https://books.google.com.hk/books /about/%E4%BF%A1%E4%BB%BB.html?id=FJ9LAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y) is that trust directly affects the size, organization, transaction scope and transaction form of a social and economic entity, as well as the indirect effects of social The scale and intensity of productive profit-seeking activities. As the basic technology, blockchain technology has built a trustless value network system through the successful definition of identity, relationship and property rights, as well as the realization of economic incentives through tokens, and the realization of governance logic through smart contracts. This cryptography-based value network provides an organizational mechanism for a new society. These networks are bound by protocols, and protocols are bound by mathematics. Relevant parties can participate in the protocol governance in a trustless manner in accordance with the methods stipulated in the agreement, and cooperate with each other, jointly produce and distribute profits, so that for the first time, humans can coordinate a large number of related parties in a real-time and trustless manner on a global scale, greatly It reduces the cost of trust seeking of relevant parties, thereby reducing transaction costs, expanding social division of labor, production and transaction scale, stimulating economic vitality and promoting economic development.

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is the embryonic form of this new social organization mechanism, and Decentralized Society (DeSoc) is the end point of this organizational mechanism. In 2022, a variety of DAO organizations will sprout up. The trustless collaboration within these organizations needs to improve organizational incentive rules, reward contributions and punish evildoers. Asset disposal, organizational development, etc. need to be decided through proposals and voting to ensure that the organization Everyone inside has a voice. All behaviors are made public, and the rules will be encoded into the decentralized autonomous organization through code.

In the traditional world, modern civilizations such as literature, thinking, science, laws and regulations are all created on paper media. Every word written on a book records the culture and rules of the traditional world. It is difficult to tamper with and spread through books. reach a broad consensus. In the digital world, code logic is digital regulations, and the traditional Internet can only provide platform-level centralized credit and security commitments, which is highly vulnerable. Governance rules defined by blockchain technology, just like the legal provisions in the real world, need to be approved by the People's Congress. Even hackers cannot tamper with the rules. Civilization products such as literature, thinking, science, laws and regulations can exist in the digital world in new forms. It is written on the blockchain, just like written in a book, which is real, tangible and endless.

At present, many conditions are not met. The lack of infrastructure conditions makes the current DAO still maintain a strong centralized operation. At the same time, although many construction contents are open, they are difficult to trace, verify, and can be tampered with, such as records of members' contributions, certification, profit distribution, etc. These contents At present, it still requires a lot of labor costs, is inefficient, and there is still the possibility of fraud.

There is still a lot of work to be done in this new form of collaboration between decentralized organizations and society. In addition to technology, there is a need for a lot of exploration and innovation in governance models.

## The stack of the value network

We try to delineate the stack of the Web3 value network:

1. The bottom layer is the blockchain technology itself. It has been innovating continuously since its birth. The most mainstream view is that the first-layer blockchain network is combined with the second-layer blockchain network to modularize the blockchain. , thereby improving blockchain performance.
2. The second layer is the state converter and middleware, which connect the protocol built on the blockchain and the blockchain itself, state converters such as EVM and the second-layer network CariroVM, ZKEVM, ZKVM, etc. Middleware mainly includes storage, indexing, nodes and message passing. Storage solutions are constantly being upgraded and innovated, ranging from IPFS to Filecoin to Arweave to Ceramic, etc.; indexing tools are mainly the index of data on the chain (such as The Graph) and the index of storage tools (such as Kwil), the main purpose of which is to directly The data used is converted into a data set with a friendly format and easy to use; the node provides some hosting services to facilitate developers to quickly test and build their own protocols, and provide some functional APIs such as storage service APIs for developers to directly call, improve development Speed; Messaging tools are designed to open up on-chain and off-chain communication and between different blockchains, including oracles (such as Chainlink) and cross-chain protocols (such as Connext) in general.
3. The third layer is tokens and smart contracts, which are the continuation of value flow scenarios. Tokens can be used as value storage and exchange media, and the combination of smart contract standards and tokens makes tokens have governance utility. The code contract logic deployed on the blockchain has innovatively optimized the circulation of tokens from the perspective of liquidity, such as AMM-based DEX (such as Uniswap), collateralized lending (such as Aave), insurance and derivatives (such as Everlasting). Renewal contract exchange GMX, dYdX) and so on.
4. The fourth layer is the user terminal, which is the entrance to the value flow scenario, including deposit and withdrawal solutions, wallets, and Dapps. The difference between Dapp and the third-layer protocol here is mainly that it refers to the application itself, which is not composable, while the third layer mainly refers to the protocol itself, which is composable. At the same time, Dapp also has More complex interactive scenarios, such as GameFi with a lot of playable content and interactions, and SocialFi with a lot of user interaction content, are protocol-independent.
5. The fifth layer is the decentralized organization. It is not only the use of the Internet of Values ​​by individuals, but also the collaboration of a group of people under the Internet of Values. It requires more cooperation between people. These cooperation methods are not yet available. Not clear, we call these collaborative Dapps DAO Tools (eg Dework).

整个价值互联网堆栈支撑起了价值流动场景，其中仍然有很多技术方案并不完美，每个组件之间相互配合的模式也在不断变化，我们认识到有些模块的分类可能存在一些可调整的地方，而且加密领域时刻发生着伟大的创新，这张图表可能难以囊括，这是一份动态调整版本的堆栈模型，供同行交流讨论。

# 价值网络的实现场景

价值流动是在实体与实体的互动中产生的，这个实体可以是人、机器人、数字化的物品甚至是一段固定的智能合约代码。在这个过程当中，就涉及到身份、关系与权利的定义，从而产生社会性，连接这种社会性的纽带是信任。区块链为中心的价值互联网就是在降低这个信任成本，包括投资、消费、认证和信用背书等等。

交易是价值网络最基本的实现。说到交易我们会立马想到生活当中的衣食住行等消费行为以及投资贷款等金融行为，但区块链天生并不是为了承接现实生活中的金融交易场景，它提供的是数字世界的真相。短期内，现实生活的法定代币、金融交易不会也不需要被优化与替代。当我们去审视一个交易场景的协议或者应用的时候，我们应该思考：
1. 它解决的交易场景问题是现实交互还是数字原生的？
	1. 如果是现实交互，目前这个阶段这个问题重要吗？会带来大规模应用吗？
	2. 如果是数字原生，这个交易问题为什么需要被解决？
2. 它解决的问题相对竞品来说是优化的，还是创新的？
3. 它的实现方案安全吗？（如去中心化程度低，技术不成熟等）
4. 该具体交易场景需要保证隐私吗？
5. ……

泛娱乐是价值网络基于交易的衍生。这里的娱乐包括游戏、粉丝经济、内容消费等等，凡是和社群与金融行为有关的娱乐都可以包括在内，与交易相比，娱乐场景的主要服务是与区块链无关的，只有涉及到金融场景才会使用区块链。然而，这里往往会有人忽视的一点是，用户在使用这些应用过程中产生的数据也应算作金融场景。数据作为生产要素之一，其资本属性决定了其金融属性，传统互联网从用户提供的数据资本中攫取大量的利益，传统技术架构及应用逻辑使得中心化实体本身没有动力去将原本属于用户的利益返还给用户，而法律法规监管的滞后，更导致中心化实体对数据的垄断以及意识的缺失。当我们去审视一个泛娱乐场景的应用的时候，我们应该思考：
1. 它在解决一个什么样的金融化问题？
2. 它的去中心化方案是什么样的？
3. 它如何处置用户的数据？
4. 它是否提供了一个新的利润分配机制？
5. 应用中权力的分配是如何的？实体之间如何互动？
6. ……

协调是价值网络的终极目标。通过重新设计金钱、提供大量的公共物品以及发明基于加密经济学的治理机制，区块链以新的方式协调人类和物品的分工、生产和生活。这是一个中远期的目标，尽管目前已经见到一个并不标准的形态——去中心化组织。目前大多数去中心化组织都是不标准的，他们有很强的中心化属性，但并不像公司和政府一样严肃，就像一个帮派，有强有力的领导者与共同的愿景驱动。这主要是由于人们目前没有探索出一个高效的去中心化协作方式，这个过程是进化的过程，需要遇到问题解决问题，从而诞生更多的 DAO 工具，为去中心化的协调提供武器。当我们去审视一个协调场景的应用的时候，我们应该思考：
1. 它在解决一个什么样的协调问题？
2. 它是去中心化的吗，效率又如何？
3. 它如何处置用户的数据？
4. ……

区块链为数字世界带来了规则与真相，在人类现实社会与数字虚拟社会进一步交融的现代，这项技术带来的变革是可以预见的。在 Zonff Partners，我们相信 Web3 将为互联网创建一个价值层，人类可以在数字世界真正拥有与自由处置自己的资产，数据将成为可以流动的资产，实体与实体之间的信任将由网络保障，从而形成一个更高效率的人类协调形式，提高生产效率。
